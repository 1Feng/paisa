**Paisa** is a command line tool and WebGUI to visualize personal
finance, specially tailored for Indians. It builds on top of the
[ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) double entry accounting tool. Checkout [documentation](https://ananthakumaran.in/paisa/)
to get started.

# Demo

A demo of the WebGUI can be found at [https://paisa-demo.ananthakumaran.in](https://paisa-demo.ananthakumaran.in)

## Status

I use it to track my personal finance. It's more like alpha product
now, usable, but I might update things based on the feedback I
receive. Feel free to open an issue if you found a bug or start a
discussion if you have a feature request.
